# Classes Example List
Below there are examples on how to use the library classes.
The target of this classes is to USE THEM, not to adapt! 
In this way, no time will be wasted!!!
So, if you have suggestions, please contact me :)
If you want to use them, it will be enough to copy the code of the whole class
and paste it into an include if you are in a report, or in the code-based builder of SE24.
NB If you are in a report, 
you will need to comment the following line code at the beginning of the class declaration.
  final
  create public .
